The Video Information Extractor is a Python script that extracts information about a video file, such as its dimensions, number of frames, and frame rate.

Install OpenCV:

``pip install opencv-python``

Place the video file (video.mp4) you want to analyze in the project folder.

Run the script:

``python video_info_extractor.py``

The script will print the width, height, total number of frames, and frame rate of the video to the console.
